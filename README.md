# The `{webexercises}` package

<img src="man/figures/logo.png" style="float:right; max-width:280px; width: 25%;" />

The goal of `{webexercises}` is to enable instructors to easily create
interactive web pages that students can use in self-guided learning.
Although `{webexercises}` has fewer features than RStudioâ€™s
[learnr](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/) package, it is more
lightweight: whereas `{learnr}` tutorials must be either hosted on a
shiny server or run locally, `{webexercises}` creates standalone HTML
files that require only a JavaScript-enabled browser. It is also
extremely simple to use. See the [webexercises
website](https://psyteachr.github.io/webexercises/) for demos and
instructions.

## Installation

You can install `{webexercises}` from CRAN using:

``` r
install.packages("webexercises")
```

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/PsyTeachR/webexercises) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("psyteachr/webexercises")
```
